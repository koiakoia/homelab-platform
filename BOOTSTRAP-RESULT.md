# Bootstrap Result — Multi-Agent Coordination Infrastructure
**Date:** 2026-03-18
**Session type:** SETUP (no platform work performed)
**Operator:** Jim Haist

---

## Phase 0: Inventory Results

### CLAUDE.md Files
- `~/overwatch/CLAUDE.md` — EXISTS (367 lines → now 413 lines with coordination rules appended)
- `~/sentinel-iac/CLAUDE.md` — EXISTS (367 lines → now 413 lines with coordination rules appended)
- `~/overwatch-gitops/CLAUDE.md` — EXISTS (367 lines → now 413 lines with coordination rules appended)

### Git Remotes
All three repos use **GitLab** at `${GITLAB_IP}` (${GITLAB_USER} namespace), NOT Forgejo.
- `sentinel-iac` → `http://oauth2:glpat-***@${GITLAB_IP}/${GITLAB_NAMESPACE}/sentinel-iac.git`
- `overwatch` → `http://oauth2:glpat-***@${GITLAB_IP}/${GITLAB_NAMESPACE}/overwatch.git`
- `overwatch-gitops` → `http://oauth2:glpat-***@${GITLAB_IP}/${GITLAB_NAMESPACE}/overwatch-gitops.git`

### Plane API
- **Status:** REACHABLE (302 on `/`, 401 on `/api/v1/users/me/` = auth required)
- **With API key:** 200, authenticated as `jim / jim@${DOMAIN}`
- **Workspace:** `${WORKSPACE_SLUG}`
- **Projects verified:** OPS, SEC, COMP, HAIST (4 projects, all confirmed via API)
- **API key location:** Vault `secret/plane/api-key`
- **Vault CLI:** NOT on workstation. Used curl to Vault API via Pangolin proxy.

### Compliance Check
- **Cannot run live** from workstation — WAZUH_PASS not set, no compliance.env, vault CLI not installed
- **Script location:** `~/sentinel-iac/scripts/nist-compliance-check.sh` (NOT `~/scripts/`)
- **Script runs on:** iac-control (${IAC_CONTROL_IP}) via cron
- **Cached result (2026-03-15T06:02:27Z):** 120/125 PASS, 0 FAIL, 5 WARN (96%), COMPLIANT
- **5 persistent WARNs:** vault_token_ttl, training_records, secure_development, senior_official, non_repudiation

### Recent Commits
See `/tmp/bootstrap-inventory.md` for full listing. Key observations:
- sentinel-iac: Most recent doc commit `750813c` [COMP-5] on gap-analysis
- overwatch: Most recent `41fcdde` [OPS-7] CLAUDE.md update
- overwatch-gitops: Most recent `c9a5015` [OPS-40] imagePullSecrets

## Files Created This Session

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/overwatch/agent-roles.md` | Role definitions: PLANNER, WORKER, JUDGE, COMPLIANCE-SCRIBE |
| `~/overwatch/AGENT-STATE-TEMPLATE.md` | Session-end state template for all agents |
| `~/overwatch/check-strength.yaml` | Registry of weak/trivial/misleading compliance checks |
| `~/overwatch/scripts/judge-verify.sh` | Judge verification script (JSON-based, tested) |
| `~/overwatch/BOOTSTRAP-RESULT.md` | This file |
| `/tmp/bootstrap-inventory.md` | Phase 0 raw inventory |

## Files Modified This Session

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `~/overwatch/CLAUDE.md` | Appended "Multi-Agent Coordination Rules" section (46 lines) |
| `~/sentinel-iac/CLAUDE.md` | Appended identical coordination rules section |
| `~/overwatch-gitops/CLAUDE.md` | Appended identical coordination rules section |

## What Is NOT Done (and Why)

### 1. check-strength.yaml is not exhaustive
Only covers the ~20 checks identified as weak/trivial/misleading/proxy in the research audit.
The remaining ~105 checks are implicitly "strong" or "moderate" — Jim should validate this
assumption and add any he disagrees with.

### 2. Judge script runs locally with cached data
The judge-verify.sh reads `nist-compliance-latest.json` from sentinel-cache, which is synced
from iac-control. It does NOT SSH to iac-control and run the check live. For authoritative
results, the check must be triggered on iac-control first, then sentinel-cache synced.

**Options for Jim:**
- Add a `ssh iac-control 'bash ~/sentinel-iac/scripts/nist-compliance-check.sh'` step to judge-verify.sh
- Or rely on the cron schedule (runs daily at 6AM) and accept ~24h staleness
- Or set up a Forgejo/GitLab webhook that triggers the check on MR merge

### 3. No CI enforcement of modifies_files constraint
The `modifies_files` constraint is in CLAUDE.md instructions only — agents could ignore it
under pressure. Jim should consider a `.gitlab-ci.yml` job or pre-commit hook that compares
changed files against the issue's `modifies_files` list. This is the single strongest
protection against the SSP overwrite scenario (commit bf9f8df) identified in the research audit.

### 4. No Plane webhook integration
The Judge role currently requires manual invocation. For full automation, a GitLab webhook
on MR merge should trigger judge-verify.sh and post the result back to Plane. This requires
GitLab CI configuration — out of scope for this bootstrap session.

### 5. Reconciliation agent prompt not created
The daily reconciliation agent (distinct from COMPLIANCE-SCRIBE) that syncs current-state.md
and score-history.md is referenced in the roles but not created. Jim mentioned having built
a reconciliation agent prompt separately — it should be placed alongside these artifacts.

### 6. Files not committed or pushed
All files are created locally. Jim needs to review, commit, and push. This is intentional —
the bootstrap session should not push to main without operator review.

---

## What Jim Needs to Do Manually

1. **Review all created/modified files** — especially agent-roles.md and the CLAUDE.md additions
2. **Commit and push** the changes to all three repos (or create MRs for review)
3. **Export PLANE_API_KEY** for future agent sessions:
   ```bash
   export PLANE_API_KEY=$(curl -sk "https://${PROXY_IP}/v1/secret/data/plane/api-key" \
     -H "Host: vault.${INTERNAL_DOMAIN}" -H "X-Vault-Token: ${VAULT_TOKEN}" \
     | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(list(json.load(sys.stdin)['data']['data'].values())[0])")
   ```
4. **Decide on CI enforcement** for modifies_files (recommended but not built)
5. **Place the reconciliation agent prompt** alongside these artifacts
6. **Validate check-strength.yaml** — add any checks Jim considers weak that aren't listed

---

## Next Step: PLANNER First Run

Copy-paste this prompt to start the PLANNER agent for the first time:

```
You are the PLANNER agent for the Overwatch Platform.

READ THESE FILES FIRST (in this order):
1. ~/overwatch/agent-roles.md — your role definition and constraints
2. ~/overwatch/CLAUDE.md — platform operating framework + coordination rules
3. ~/overwatch/check-strength.yaml — which compliance checks are weak/trivial
4. ~/sentinel-cache/config-cache/nist-compliance-latest.json — current compliance state
5. ~/sentinel-iac/docs/nist-gap-analysis.md — known gaps between SSP and reality
6. ~/sentinel-cache/current-state.md — platform infrastructure state
7. ~/sentinel-cache/task-queue.md — existing backlog items

SESSION CREDENTIALS:
- VAULT_TOKEN: {paste token}
- PLANE_API_KEY: {paste key or Vault command above}
- WORKSPACE_SLUG: ${WORKSPACE_SLUG}

YOUR TASK:
Based on the current platform state, the gap analysis findings, the research audit
at /tmp/research-audit-2026-03-18.md, and Jim's strategic priorities, create
Plane issues for the next sprint.

PRIORITIES (Jim's intent):
1. Fix the SSP overwrite — the OSCAL SSP has 259 "planned" controls that should
   be "implemented" or "partial" (commit bf9f8df destroyed the fix)
2. Improve check quality for the weakest checks (check-strength.yaml)
3. Resolve the 5 persistent WARNs if feasible

CONSTRAINTS:
- Each issue must have: title, description, acceptance_criteria (machine-verifiable),
  blocked_by, modifies_files (exact paths)
- Do not create issues for controls with only trivial checks without first creating
  an issue to improve the check
- Post your session output to ~/overwatch/PLANNER-STATE.md
- Do NOT do any infrastructure or compliance work yourself
```
